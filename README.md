# SafianGRIDtx
SafianGridtx is a MATLAB software that provides an easy-to-use simulation tool for academics and instructors.
SafianGridtx is a Matpower-inspired grid with a range of display and manipulation options.

To the best of my ability, I tested and evaluated the simulation tool using various situations. 
As a user of this simulation programme, you may assist us in improving future versions by providing feedback on any problems,
inconsistencies, or bugs. Please see my LinkedIn profile for additional information:
